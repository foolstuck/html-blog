  <p>Hello, welcome to my blog. I'm Mark from China. I made this blog with plain html and some css.
    I will not be doing SEO for this site since it only serves as a note to keep me on track.

  <p>My goal in 2024 is to find a consistent method to generate passive income online. I'm not aiming to replace my job but to make some extra money like $1000 per month or so.
    Currently, I want to try affiliate marketing since I've seen a lot of people getting money from it. I will try Pinterest and other social media platforms first, then move to
    ads eventually.
