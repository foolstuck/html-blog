  <p>I'm currently working as a marketing manager in a small company for aluminum export business. I got this job in around March, 2023.
    It pays alright, but I'm not really happy with it since I only get 6 days off per month and my boss sits with us and monitoring us - 
    not a healthy working environment at all!
  </p>
  <h2>What's my plan in the near future?</h2>
  <p>I have a plan to get a new job in the next 6 months. I guess I will start looking for it in July or whenever I feel like it. The preferred 
    location is northwest of Zhengzhou since it is close to my new home, but I'm also open to other locations within 30 minutes of drive. The job
    should only have 2 days off per week. The company should have at least 50 employees in the headquarters so there's room for promotions.</p>
