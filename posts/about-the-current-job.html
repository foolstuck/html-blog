  <p>I'm currently working as a marketing manager in a small company for aluminum export business. I got this job in around March, 2023.
    It pays alright, but I'm not really happy with it since I only get 6 days off per month and my boss sits with us and monitoring us - 
    not a healthy working environment at all!
  </p>
  <h2>What's my plan in the near future?</h2>
  <p>I have a plan to get a new job in the next 6 months. I guess I will start looking for it in July or whenever I feel like it. The preferred 
    location is northwest of Zhengzhou since it is close to my new home, but I'm also open to other locations within 30 minutes of drive.</p>
