<h2>Why Do I Want to Save Money?</h2>
<p>Because I don't have any and I have freaking 3500 rmb debt to pay every single month. I know it may sound like a lot of money but
  I only make less than 1,0000 rmb a month.
</p>
<h2>How Do I Save Money?</h2>
<p>Once we have a little background of why I should save money, here comes the question: how do I save money?</p>
<p>I wouldn't say just not buying anything because it is not realistic and practical. I came up a idea of things I
   should be buying and things I could save. I will only count the things I have control of. For example, if I get sick and need to buy
  medicine or my car needs to be repaired, I can't do anything about it.</p>
<ul>
  <h3>Things I should buy:</h3>
  <li>Food ~ 1000 rmb</li>
  <li>Commute ~ 150 rmb (Don't take taxi, you poor fuck!)</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
