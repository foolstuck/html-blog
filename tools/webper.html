  <h2>What is WebPer?</h2>
  <img src="../images/webper.webp" alt="webper easy to use webp converter">
  <p>WebPer is a simple tool to convert images to WebP format. It is a lossless image format that is 20% smaller than PNG and 80% smaller than JPEG.
     It is also faster to load than JPEG and PNG. WebP is supported by all modern browsers.
