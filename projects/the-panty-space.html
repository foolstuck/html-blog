  <h2>How did I come up with this weird idea?</h2>
  <p>I always want to do some side projects to make extra cash because I'm broke as hell. Porn tube is the first thing came to my mind but it isn't going
     to work for me due to the restriction. Then, I discovered this business of selling women used panties. It has a fairly low comptition and a decent search
    volume.</p>
  <h2>What's my connection to this business?</h2>
  <p>I'm not gonna predent to be a gentleman here. I once had a female roommate for 2 months in my early 20s. We shared a small condo with only 1 bathroom, so yeah,
    it is not quite convinient for her. I almost had seen her naked in the bathroom once because she thought I was not home. Then, I sometimes fantasized about her naked body
    and how it would look like if she was naked in my bed. I also fantasized about how I would sneak to her bed and fuck her at night. One day, I saw that she hanged her wash panties
    on a string in her room through the door gap and I decided to go insde and perhaps jerk off with her panties. I was surprised that I found a unwashed panty besides her pillow. I
    didn't know what drove me do that but I took a deep sniff - nnpfffff, ahhhh. The aroma was a well blend of the scent of her vagina and a delightfull laundry smell.
    I then couldn't control myself to not jerk off with her used panty. Quite honestly, that was one of my best musterabation experience.
