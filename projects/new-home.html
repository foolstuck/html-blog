  <p>I'm very happy to offcially get my first home in the age of 30. It is a second hand rough condo, meaning it has not furnished at all.</p>
  <p>The next thing is to furnish the house. There are mainly 2 ways to furnish a house in China. The easy way is to hire furnishing company to do it.
    They will be in charge of everything from A-Z. They only thing you gotta do is deciding among the options they offer. The more economy way is to hire
    a foreman who has connections with workers to get the jobs done. 
  </p>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Here is a floor plan of the house and it had been modified a little bit to meet my needs.</p>
